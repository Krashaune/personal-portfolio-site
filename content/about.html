        <h1>At a glance</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, WA. Attended Washington State University and received a BA in Human Development.</p>
        <p> Before starting at Ada Developers Academy, I worked at Treehouse, a Seattle non-profit for 5 and a half years. Throughout my various positions at Treehouse data and tech were always of interest. My last position was Systems Analyst working along side the database administrator improving the database and managing data quality.</p> 

        <p>My life wouldnâ€™t be the same without music!</p>

        </p>Favs: trying new foods/restaurants, binging crime shows, watching sports movies, and HGTV.</p>

        <p>Love: going to concerts, tropical beaches, and spending time with my nieces and nephews.</p>

        <p>Cool fact: I won the car I currently drive.</p>

        <p> I am very passionate about living a positive healthy life</p>
        <p> I am also very passionate about giving back to my community</p>
